# raycast
This is my version of a simple raycasting engine as seen in [3dSages video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA&t=876s). I implemented it in python and the GUI in javascript using Eel. I want to see how I can further optimize it and what I can use it for. At the moment, you are only able to place colored walls and walk around. I also want to try implementing the ray casting version of [Lode](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) to understand the maths behind it better.
